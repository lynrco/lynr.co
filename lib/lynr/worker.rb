  # # `Lynr::Worker`
  #
  # Workhorse class for job queue processing. `Worker` creates a `JobQueue` and then
  # subscribes to the channel waiting for message deliveries. Messges are processed
  # one at a time by invoking the `Job`'s `#perform` method. `Worker` traps `QUIT`,
  # `TERM`, and `INT` signals and invokes `Worker#stop` upon receipt of one of these
  # signals to gracefully stop the `JobQueue` consumers and tell the `Process` to exit.
  # The `#stop` method is also invoked when `Job#perform` or `JobQueue#subscribe` raise
  # exceptions. Worker is a process aware wrapper around `Lynr::Queue::JobQueue`.
  #
