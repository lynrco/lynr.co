  # Module to be included by `Lynr::Model` objects which defines how equality
  # works for modle objects. Classes including the `Model::Base` module should
  # define a `#view` method to provide a `Hash` representation of itself. If the
  # including class will `respond_to?(:equality_fields)` then `#==` will be defined
  # to compare values from `#equality_fields` otherwise `#==` is defined to compare
  # two instances based on their `#view`s.
