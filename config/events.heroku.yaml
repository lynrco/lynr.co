# Event handlers are configured here. They are configured by mapping
# an event name to an Array of Event handler configurations. An example
# configuration might look like:
#
#     dealership.created:
#       - type: Lynr::Events::Handler::Email
#         :template: 'auth/account_created'
#         :subject: "Lynr.co Account Created"
#
# `type:` specifies the class name of the handler to be created. When
# handlers are created they are passed the entire event handler
# configuration as a `Lynr::Config` instance.
#
# '*' is a event "type" that is executed for each event.
#
